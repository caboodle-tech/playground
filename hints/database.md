# Help With Database Demo

Keep in mind this demo is using a SQLite database. How you interact with and query the database will differ from MySQL or SQL.

### Q: Are you struggling to remember how to return a database schema from the database itself?

### A:
- A well worded internet search or conversation with an AI will get you up to speed in now time.
- We provided you with an image of the database structure, but don't look in the images folder that would be too easy! How else could you display this image? One thing you can do is fix the collapsible box on the page.

### Q: Why no SQL command history?

### A:
- The functionality for the history box has already been completed. Can you figure out how to "activate" that feature? Something might be missing in the JavaScript.
