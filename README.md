#  Miniature Cloud and Generative AI Playground

This repository contains 3 different demos in the `www` directory. Each demo relates to Cloud Computing in some way and each demo is broken in some way; `HTML`, `CSS`, or `JS`.

You should explore each demo and attempt to fix or improve them. Using a generative AI (ChatGPT, Bard, Copilot, Anthropic) to help you is highly encouraged!

**Note:** The chat demo will require at least 2 separate devices running this demo. Choose on of the machines IP address and port number to be the "Cloud Chat Server".
